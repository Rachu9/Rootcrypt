routecrypt is a user-friendly web application that allows you to securely encrypt and decrypt your messages using a customizable key. It ensures the confidentiality of your communications with simple, effective encryption. The project offers features to encrypt messages by converting plain text into encrypted text using a custom encryption key, and to decrypt messages by converting encrypted text back to its original form using the same encryption key.
To get started, clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory. Open the index.html file in your web browser to run the application. The interface allows you to enter a message in the "Enter a message to encrypt" textarea and an encryption key in the corresponding input field. By clicking the "Encrypt" button, you can view the encrypted message. Similarly, you can enter an encrypted message in the "Enter a message to decrypt" textarea and the decryption key (the same number used for encryption) in the input field. Clicking the "Decrypt" button will reveal the original message.
 The project is built with HTML, CSS, python and JavaScript.
